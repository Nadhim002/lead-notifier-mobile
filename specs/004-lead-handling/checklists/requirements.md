# Specification Quality Checklist: Lead Handling

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded (delivery mechanics while backgrounded/killed are explicitly
      deferred to the Notifications feature)
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows (live alert, history browsing, detail/call, test-lead
      labeling)
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria (already true today — this is
      a baseline of shipped behavior, not a target to build toward)
- [x] No implementation details leak into Requirements or Success Criteria sections

## Notes

- This spec documents existing behavior rather than proposing new behavior, so "Feature Readiness"
  is being validated against the app as it ships today, not a future build.
- Depends on Notifications for delivery while backgrounded/killed, and on Entitlement/Device
  Management having already gated the user into the app.
- All items pass. Ready for `/speckit-plan` if/when a change to this feature is proposed.
